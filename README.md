## The Tasks / Challenges

- In 30 days, I built multi-pages ecommerce website using react and react version of typescript.

- Using react hook for the state management was challenging. I will use Redux for future project.

- Building an app or website with react and typescript together was challenging

- Connecting various functionalities or features into the e-cart (this project)

#### Goal:

- to make the buttons/features work properly and practice ReactJS and TypeScript in building ecommerce website

## Link

- Live Site URL:[e-cart](https://master.d1p994hz5fex3u.amplifyapp.com)

## The process

- It took me long time to research and identify the app I'm going to build and technologies used.

- I created the repository and installed the necessary packages such as react-router, â€¢ firebase & bootstrap.

- I work on the folder structure and continue building the project

  - cmp (Navbar, CartItem, ShoppingCart, StoreItem)
  - pages (shows routes in the app, & store has the content of the app)
  - data (data in the store is json by default)
  - context (my entire shopping cart fit inside of the context)
  - hooks (useLocalStorage (custom hooks), I used it to make sure that if I add sth to the cart and refresh the page it is going to stay in the cart)
  - router (for routing all the cmp using Routes & Route)
  - utilities (for formatting the currency)
  - checkout
  - wishlist
  - order / receipt
  - refund / return

- I used Firebase for the authentication and DB(firestore), hooks for the state management and react router for routing across the pages.

## Technologies used:

- ReactJS and TypeScript: for building the User Interface (app)

- Bootstrap, react-bootstrap, and framer-motion: for styling

- React-router: for routing across pages

- React-hooks: for state management

- Firebase: for authentication and db(firestore)

- AWS Amplify: for deploying the app(website)

## Lessons learned:

- I learnt the importance of conducting research before started building the app

- I consulted team members and the lead and gained new experience

- I learnt more about the github (a cloud-based hosting service) while building the project.
