## The process

- It took me long time to research and identify the app I build and technologies used. Then, I created the repository and installed necessary packages and libraries. <br/>

- I used hooks for the state management, and Firebase for the authentication.

- The e-cart a shopping cart built using

  - ReactJS
  - TypeScript
  - Semantic HTML5
  - Bootstrap, react-bootstrap
  - React Router
  - [React Hooks]
  - Firebase (firestore, authentication)
  - AWS Amplify for hosting/deployment

- Lessons learned:
  - I conducted research and picked technologies to build the app.
  - I consulted team members and the lead , which is a great experience. I took the opportunity to learn some new tools.
  - I learnt more how to collaborate & use the git/github.com (code push/pull, resolved merge conflict, etc...) while building the project.
