## The Task / Challenge

- In 30 days, I created a multi-pages react and typescript shopping cart.

- Stretch Goals:

  - I used react hooks for the state management, firebase for authentication & firestore for creating the database.

## Link

- Live Site URL:[e-cart]() ](https://master.d1p994hz5fex3u.amplifyapp.com/)

## The process

- It took me long time to research and identify the app I build and technologies used. Then, I created the repository and installed necessary packages and libraries. <br/>

- I used hooks for the state management, and Firebase for the authentication and react router for routing across the pages.

## Technoloogies used:

- ReactJS and TypeScript: for building the User Interface (app)
- Bootstrap, react-bootstrap: for styling
- React-router: for routing across pages
- React-hooks: for state management
- Firebase: for authentication and db(firestore)
- AWS Amplify: for deploying the app(website)

- Lessons learned:
  - I conducted research and picked technologies to build the e-commerce website with React and typeScript.
  - I consulted team members and the lead , which is a great experience and I took the opportunity to learn some new tools.
  - I learnt more how to collaborate & use the git/github.com (code push/pull, resolved merge conflict, etc...) while building the project.
