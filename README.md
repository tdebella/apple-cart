## The Task / Challenge

- In 30 days, I created a multi-pages react and typescript shopping cart.

- Goal: to make the button work properly and practice React and TypeScript in building ecommerce website

## Link

- Live Site URL:[e-cart]() ](https://master.d1p994hz5fex3u.amplifyapp.com/)

## The process

- It took me long time to research and identify the app I'm going to build and technologies used.

- I created the repository and installed the necessary packages such as react-router, â€¢ firebase & bootstrap.

- I work on the folder structure and continue building the project

- I used Firebase for the authentication and DB(firestore), hooks for the state management and react router for routing across the pages.

## Technologies used:

- ReactJS and TypeScript: for building the User Interface (app)

- Bootstrap, react-bootstrap, and framer-motion: for styling

- React-router: for routing across pages

- React-hooks: for state management

- Firebase: for authentication and db(firestore)

- AWS Amplify: for deploying the app(website)

- Lessons learned:

  - I learnt the importance of conducting research before started building the app

  - I consulted team members and the lead and gained new experience

  - I learnt more about the github (a cloud-based hosting service) while building the project.
